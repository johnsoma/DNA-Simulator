# DNA-Simulator
Created for an online course, this program simulates the DNA of a mysterious (fictional) creature known as pAequor. It has functionality to generate random dna mutations, compare one subject to another, determine if a subject is likely to survive in a natural environment, and can mass produce artifical DNA samples
